## Project Description
This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and processing data from various sources, including AWS RDS, S3 buckets, and external APIs. The primary aim is to prepare the data for further analysis or database storage, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Key learnings and challenges in this project include working with different data formats (CSV, JSON), handling database connections, and implementing data cleaning techniques using Pandas in Python.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. **Install Required Python Packages:**
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required packages:
```
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy psycopg2 boto3 pyyaml tabula-py requests
```

3. **Database Configuration:**
- Create a PostgreSQL database.
- Update the `db_creds.yaml` file with your database credentials.

4. **AWS Configuration:**
- Ensure you have AWS credentials set up for accessing RDS and S3 services. This typically involves setting up `~/.aws/credentials`.

## Usage
To run the data cleaning and extraction scripts, execute the `main.py` file:
```
python main.py
```
This will trigger the data extraction, cleaning, and uploading processes as defined in the main function.

## File Structure
- `data_cleaning.py`: Contains the `DataCleaning` class with methods for cleaning various data tables.
- `data_extraction.py`: Includes the `DataExtractor` class for extracting data from RDS, S3, and APIs.
- `database_utils.py`: Defines the `DatabaseConnector` class for database connection and operations.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the data processing tasks.
